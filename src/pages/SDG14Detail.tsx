                Oceans cover more than 70% of our planet and are essential for all life on Earth. They 
                generate most of the oxygen we breathe, absorb a significant portion of carbon dioxide 
                emissions, provide food and livelihoods for billions of people, and are home to an 
                incredible diversity of life.

                However, human activities are placing unprecedented pressure on ocean ecosystems. Plastic 
                pollution, overfishing, ocean acidification, and rising sea temperatures threaten marine 
                biodiversity and the communities that depend on healthy oceans.

                SDG 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources. This 
                includes reducing marine pollution, protecting marine ecosystems, addressing ocean acidification, 
                implementing sustainable fishing practices, and increasing scientific knowledge about our oceans. 
                Protecting our oceans is not just about preserving biodiversityâ€”it's essential for sustainable development, 
                food security, and climate regulation.
