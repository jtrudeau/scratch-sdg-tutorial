                Water is the foundation of life and human civilization. Access to clean water and sanitation is 
                not just a basic human rightâ€”it's essential for public health, poverty reduction, 
                food security, and ecosystem protection.

              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                Despite progress, billions of people still lack access to safe water, sanitation, and handwashing 
                facilities. Every day, nearly 1,000 children die from preventable water and sanitation-related diseases.

                SDG 6 aims to ensure access to clean water and sanitation for all, improve water quality, increase 
                water-use efficiency, protect water-related ecosystems, and expand water management cooperation. 
                Achieving this goal is critical for sustainable development and the dignity of all people.
