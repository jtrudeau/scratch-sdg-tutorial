                Cities are hubs for ideas, commerce, culture, science, productivity, and social development. 
                However, many challenges exist to maintaining cities in a way that continues to create jobs 
                and prosperity while not straining land and resources.

              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                Today, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, and by 2050, that figure 
                will rise to 6.5 billion people. Rapid urbanization is resulting in growing numbers of slum 
                dwellers, inadequate infrastructure, and increased air pollution.

                SDG 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. 
                This involves ensuring access to safe and affordable housing, upgrading slum settlements, improving 
                urban planning, implementing integrated policies for resource efficiency, and reducing the 
                environmental impact of cities.
