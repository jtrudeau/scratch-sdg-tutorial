                Despite producing more than enough food to feed everyone on the planet, hunger remains a critical global 
                challenge. Nearly 690 million people go hungry each day, and that number has been rising.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                Hunger and malnutrition are not just about insufficient foodâ€”they're also about inadequate nutrition, 
                unequal access to food, and unsustainable agricultural practices that degrade our environment.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable 
                agriculture. This requires transforming our food systems to be more inclusive, resilient, and 
                environmentally friendly, while ensuring that everyone has access to the nutritious food they need.
