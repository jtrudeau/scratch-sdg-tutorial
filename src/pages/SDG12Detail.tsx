                Sustainable consumption and production is about doing more and better with less. It's about 
                decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, increasing resource efficiency, 
                and promoting sustainable lifestyles.

              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                Currently, our material footprint is increasing faster than population growth and economic output. 
                The world continues to use ever-increasing amounts of natural resources to support our economic 
                activity. The way we produce, consume, and dispose of our waste causes a destructive impact on the planet.

                SDG 12 aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. This includes efficient 
                use of natural resources, reducing food waste, proper management of chemicals and waste, 
                sustainable business practices, and promoting sustainable lifestyles. The goal recognizes 
                that systemic changes are needed at all levelsâ€”from businesses to individual consumers.
